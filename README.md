## About Me
Hi, I'm Rokia! I am a passionate **Software Engineer** and **EdTech enthusiast** currently pursuing my M.A. in Instructional Media and Technology at **Teachers College, Columbia University** ('27). 

I specialize in building digital experiences that aren't just functional, but pedagogically sound. My work focuses on how technology—from generative AI to physical computing—shapes the world, especially for youth and underrepresented communities.

**Passions:** * 🤖 **AI in Education:** Developing ethical and effective learning objectives for the AI era.
* 🎮 **Game-Based Learning:** Using mechanics like trust and community to drive epistemic engagement.
* 🌍 **Culturally Relevant Tech:** Designing programs that empower underrepresented youth in STEM.
* ✂️ **Physical Computing:** Creating tangible learning tools (like paper circuits!).
