# Hello, I'm Rokia. 
### Engineer. Researcher. Creator.

## 👋🏾 The Narrative
I am a **Technologist & EdTech Researcher** working at the intersection of complex engineering and human-centered design. My journey started in **Information Science** and **Software Engineering**, where I built scalable systems for millions of users. Today, I am an M.A. student at **Teachers College, Columbia University**, focusing on how we can build intentional, ethical technology to empower the next generation of change-makers.

I believe that the tools we build today shape the engineers, doctors, and leaders of tomorrow. My goal is to transform emerging tech into meaningful, positive solutions.

## 🛠 What I Build
*I don't just write code; I design experiences that facilitate learning and engagement.*

### 🤖 AI Hub & Emerging Tech
I engineered a modern web application designed for enterprise-wide **AI prototyping and experimentation**. This project was about more than just code—it was about creating a safe community for colleagues to explore, collaborate, and maximize the potential of AI in the workplace.

### 🎮 Digital Game Design
I'm currently developing a **digital card game** that explores mechanics of community and trust. This project bridges my engineering background with my interest in game-based learning, using technical playtesting to refine educational outcomes.

### ⚡ Physical Computing & Making
I love the "tangible" side of tech. I’ve prototyped **paper circuit greeting cards** and laser-cut designs that incorporate icons of my identity. These projects explore how physical interfaces can lower the barrier to entry for STEM education.

## 🔬 Research & Passions
My academic work at Columbia centers on **Culturally Relevant Technology**. I’m currently researching how tech programming can help underrepresented youth build their identities in STEM careers and promote deep epistemic engagement.

**My Core Interests:**
* **Youth Empowerment:** Building ethical tech that serves the next generation.
* **Learning Science:** Applying pedagogical frameworks to software development.
* **Inclusive Design:** Ensuring technology is accessible and culturally relevant.
